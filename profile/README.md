## Welcome to the RealTime AI Operation in Dam effected Watershed 👋

### Currently, my team is focusing on 

🙋‍♀️ 1. Forecasting daily and hourly dam inflow using various Deep Learning approaches in neuralhydrology

🌈 2. Forecaseting daily and hourly dam downstream streaflow and waterlevel using various Deep Learning approaches in neuralhydrology

### The end of this year, we wil complete the RealTime AI Operation of Dam effected Watershed using AI

👩‍💻 3. Application of MC-LSTM to 

🍿 4. Application of Differentiable Modeling to analyze streamflow using Muskingum-Cunge

🧙 5. Data Assimilation for Real-time AI Tool Operation
